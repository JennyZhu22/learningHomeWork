I took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched, but they said the reason I had a flat was because the previous patch had blown - WAIT, WHAT? I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

There was no one in line in front of us, yet we still waited for 15 minutes before we were helped. The sales associate, yes I am calling him a sales associate because I felt like they were trying to sell me the car, Daniel was aweful and rude. He mumbled the whole time so you couldn't fully understand what he was saying, little did we know he was adding on all this extra stuff without us knowing.  He also asked a bunch of questions and I felt like it was an interrogation and felt like if you gave a wrong answer they would charge you even more. He then looked like he was getting frustrated after we didn't want to add an additional driver. He insisted to add me even though I knew I would never be driving the car since I would be with my fiance the whole time. In the end our bill was double what we had originally booked for. When we got the car it was filthy! The seats were stained and had cigarette burns in them and it smelled so bad. It looked like it was never cleaned. We had to buy our own armor all and disinfectant just to even sit in the car. I then called customer service to complain about the over charges and the condition of the vehicle. She then told me to call the office that I just rented from! Unbelievable! I told her that I was so frustrated with them at this point that I did not even want to talk to anyone in that office. Then she went ahead and opened up a ticket for me. I told her that I would never rent from this company again and her excuse was, just because you had a bad experience at one place doesn't mean the other locations are bad too! Excuse me, but your customer service in one location directly relates to the overall company!!! The only reason I gave it two stars was because they did refund me the money for the upgraded vehicle which we never was even consented for in the first place. Overall, save yourself the hassle and book with the bigger name companies like budget, enterprise, or hertz. I never had an issue with these companies and you will be paying the same amount. At least their vehicles are clean and better customer service.</td>\n",
